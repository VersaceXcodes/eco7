## Previous Validation Failures for Backend TypeScript Compilation:
- 5:04:56 PM: 
- 5:05:11 PM: 

## Your Task:
1. **Analyze the Error**: Understand what specifically went wrong in the Backend TypeScript Compilation step
2. **Check Previous Attempts**: Consider if this is a recurring issue based on validation history
3. **Locate the Problem**: Identify which files need to be modified
4. **Apply Fixes**: Use the available tools to fix the specific issues
5. **Focus on Root Cause**: Don't just suppress errors, fix the underlying problems





## Important Notes:
- You are working in a Modal Sandbox environment at /app/backend
- Make changes to the actual project files that will be used in the next validation attempt
- Always check packages are installed correctly, if not, install them, npm install
- For TypeScript errors: Fix type issues, missing imports, etc.
- For Build errors: Fix configuration issues, missing dependencies, syntax errors
- For Lint errors: Fix code style issues, unused variables, missing dependencies, etc.
- For Install errors: Fix package.json issues, dependency conflicts, etc.
- For SQL errors: Fix syntax issues, schema problems, foreign key constraints, etc.
- Use your memory context to avoid repeating failed approaches

after you have fixed the issues, run the following commands to make sure there are no errors left:
for typescript errors, run: cd /app/vitereact && npx tsc -b in /app/vitereact, it is important to run this command with -b so npx tsc -b in /app/vitereact
for lint errors run npm run lint in vitereact
for test errors, run: npm test in the appropriate directory (backend or vitereact)
for SQL errors, run: node initdb.js in the backend directory to test database initialization

MAKE SURE TO FIX ALL ERRORS! SMALL AND BIG!


The validation will retry this step after your fixes. Make sure to address the specific error shown above.
